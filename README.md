# Simple-Old-photo-restore-
This is a reference implementation of paper Bringing Old Photos Back to Life, CVPR2020 (Oral) by Ziyu Wan1, Bo Zhang2, Dongdong Chen3, Pan Zhang4, Dong Chen2, Jing Liao1, Fang Wen2 City University of Hong Kong, Microsoft Research Asia, Microsoft Cloud AI, 4 USTC   After placing an old photo restore example in this group I got several requests for doing the work for their personal image or some important historic image they have. Doing it individually is a time taken job hence I have created this colab notebook for the same.  Through this colab notebook we have tried to make a simple free web based old photo editor so that this can be easily used by any person with limited technical knowledge. And this appears like a web page for restoring their personal photos. Click on the play button at the corner of each code block. There are two code blocks. The first one is to download pre trained models, hence it takes some time. This first block needs to be executed only once for a session. The second block has to be played for each image.   This colab based programming is very useful for doing high computational coding with even mobile phone. This will help technical people posted in RSC or DSC level to try different exhibit ideas with low end computers. One workshop is under consideration by director CRTL
